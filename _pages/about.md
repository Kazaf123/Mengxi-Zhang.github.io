I'm a PH.D student from [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn), [Jilin University](https://jlu.edu.cn).
My research interests include GUI Testing, Accessibility, Data Mining, Machine Learning, LLM for SE, and Human and Computer Interaction.

I'm very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Huaxiao Liu](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1313/18404.htm) and [Full Prof. Chunyang Chen](https://chunyang-chen.github.io/)

Education
======
1. **Bachelor of Science**, Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University                                       2015.09-2019.06
2. **Master of Science**, Computer Technology, Jilin University, Supervised by Prof. Huaxiao Liu                    2019.09-2022.06
3. **Ph.D.**, Computer Software and Theory, Jilin University, Supervised by Prof. Huaxiao Liu                       2022.09-present

Research Interests
======
1. **Data Mining**: During my master's degree program, my research interest lies in mining large-scale data information from GitHub repositories. I am responsible for exploring the role of Pull_Request_Template in repository maintenance and development on GitHub, conducting an extensive empirical study.
2. **Software Accessibility**: The accessibility of software is a crucial research direction supporting its universality for all users. During my Ph.D. studies, my research interest lies in integrating intelligent software testing and timely remediation of accessibility issues in mobile application GUIs, aiming to provide a better user experience for visually impaired users.
3. **AI for Software Engineering**: My research interest is also in applying artificial intelligence (AI) methods to software engineering, where I used graph convolutional neural network (GCN) models to implement the task of detecting and fixing accessibility issues in GUIs.
